//21. breakShape
//Disclaimer! breakShape has been undocumented, mysterious and unsupported ever since 
//I started using Processing. But itâ€™s still there hidden in the source code. 
//Maybe this will change with Processing 2.0. But for now let me just mention this function
//that can create holes in a beginShape-endShape. ðŸ˜‰
